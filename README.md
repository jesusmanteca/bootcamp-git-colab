## About News on the Balance  
Allows the user to search news articles in different areas to get different points of view, to hopefully avoid any bias.  
News on the Balance takes the users input to search for relevant articles in both New York Times and the Guardian.  
It then displays click-able Headlines in two columns, one for news source.  
If the user chooses they can click a headline to be taken to the article on said news source.
